                        <h3>Zeroth Network Beacon</h3>
                        <p>A housing unit for an RFID beacon which connects to specific cat collars to monitor movements of cats near areas of interest. The housing unit contains a sliding tray on the inside which is shock protected
                            by a rigid skeleton. The entire beacon is waterproof when closed, and is difficult to open if you don't know how to use it. Using a rotary gear locking mechanism similar to those found on vault and submarine
                            doors, the interior is protected from falling out when struck, and creates an almost watertight seal to protect the sensitive electronics inside.

                        <p>The corset is an article of clothing popularized by nobles in previous centuries as a sign of status and class. As out project is focused on over-consumerism, clothing with a deep rooted history of 
                            wealth and consumption like a corset or cape were the obvious choice for our final piece of art. Creating a pattern for such a unique piece of clothing came with it's challenges, however through
                            extensive online research I was able to create my own version of it.

                        <h3>Auto Hood V.0.3</h3>
                        <p>This prototype hood system uses a dc motor and pulley system to raise and lower the hood. When a button hidden in the sleeve is pressed, the motor runs and winds in a cord, which increases tension on a 
                            lever hidden in the side of the hood. As the lever raises, a "crown" at the top which is attached to the inside of the hood raises up, bringing the hood with it. Further iterations will use moisture sensors 
                            and current weather data to raise and lower the hood, as well as using servos built into the hood itself rather than a pulley system.
